Choosing a current activated user, the selection prompt let you choose the security mode from the following options:
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Password or Biometric
<LI>Biometric Only
<LI>Password Only
</UL>
<br>
To avoid problem at the beginning, we strongly recommend selecting mode Password or Biometric. It will allow time to learn how to properly use biometrics to be successfully identified at the same time you have an alternate regular way to logon with your password. After while, if you accustomed yourself easily logon using biometric scanner, you may establish advanced security mode ‘Biometric Only’.
You will be also asked to enter and confirm windows account password to ensure that the particular user would be linked to created biometric credential record.
<p><b>Note: If you change windows account password, you must confirm it again on 
User Enrollment tab by clicking on user name and reentering new password as 
prompted. </b>
<br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Select Biometric Provider from the drop-down list above
<LI>Select finger you would like to enroll
<LI>You will be prompted to place finger on the scanner surface. Depends biometric Provider you are required to place, lift and place finger few times until good biometric data would be collected. 
</UL>

<br>
Follow the rules listed below:
<OL>
<LI>Place the center of the finger (core) tip in the middle of the sensor – there is a better chance to be accepted.
<LI>Cover the sensor area completely with the finger to ensure the maximum fingerprint surface contact area – it will collect more information (i.e. minutiae)
<LI>Use medium pressure on the sensor – too heavy or light pressure may result in a poor image and consequently incorrect enrollment.
<LI>Keep fingerprint rotation minimum during the enrollment and use the same orientation ( unless instructed by particular Provider)
<LI>It is best not to have very wet or very dry finger during enrollment procedure. Wipe your finger with cloth or paper towel if it wet, or, otherwise, if it too dry – moisturize the finger by breathing on it.<br><b><i>The image quality could be improved tremendousely by taking care of the dry/wet fingerprint condition</i></b>
</OL>
<br>
During the enrollment procedure monitoring cursor on top of the page will be indicating progress. At the end of the enrollment cycle message will be popped up: “Successfully registered”. You also may cancel the enrollment process at any time.
